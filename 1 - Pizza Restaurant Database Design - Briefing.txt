-- Introduction

Ben is opening up a new Pizza Restaurant, offering only take out and delivery services.
He would like to be helped to monitor business performances.
With this project I've build a tailormade and bespoke relational database, 
to capture and store all the important informations and data that the business generates.

-- Client requests

The main areas the client would like to focus on are: customer orders, stock control, staff members.

Customer orders data required
	- Item name
	- Item price
	- Quantity
	- Customer name
	- Delivery address

Stock control data required
	- Wants to be able to know when it's time to order new stock
	- To do this we're going to need more informations about:
		- What ingredients go into each pizza
		- Their quantity based on the size of pizza
		- The existing stock level
	- We'll assume the lead time for delivery by suppliers is the same for all ingredients

Staff data requirements
	- Wants to know which staff members are working when
	- Based on the staff salary information, how much each pizza costs (ingredients + chefs + delivery)
